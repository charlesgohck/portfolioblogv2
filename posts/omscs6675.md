# Review: CS6675 Advanced Internet Systems and Applications
## Objective
I wanted to gain a breadth of understanding of how various modern internet application systems worked at a high level. I also wanted to gain some practical experience in writing and designing modern internet application systems.
## Learning Outcome
The course goes over different internet application systems such as blockchain/cryptocurrency, web servers, and content distribution. The course content combined with the readings provides a great introduction to these various topics, such that we can return to them later to learn more. 

I enjoyed designing and writing up systems to solve problems for the assignments. The questions were focused but were open-ended enough to allow us to create a system that solves a problem area we are most interested. 

No coding was required for the course's summer version, although if time permitted, students could choose to implement one of the designed internet systems.
## Difficulty
I spent approximately **8 - 15 hours** each week on the course. Given that it is a summer course, the project section and the final topics were optional.
